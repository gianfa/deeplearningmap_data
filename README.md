# Welcome to The DeepLearning Map Project

Deep Learning is a new fantastic field of the science, based on relatively new studies and in the very last years it is experiencing an explosive growth, thanks to the computational power enhancing. While I'm writing this introduction, Google Scholar shows me 4.400.000 results for the keyword [Deep Learning](https://scholar.google.it/scholar?hl=it&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=deep+learning&btnG=&oq=deep+learning), so there is a lot to read right there.

## Why
If you've read the introduction above you know there are a lot of things around in the room, thus I thought it could be better to put some order, so that you and me are able to conceptually walk over the networks evolution. I hope this will help to clarify the mess that there is on this complex world.

## Collaborate!
Make a PR anytime you want, adding other networks to the DNN object, so that we will see the map growing thanks to your collaboration!
